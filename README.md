# Mongo
```js
let options = {
	type: "mongo"
};

let mongo = await hqDB(options);
// Return MongoClient
```

### Base methods
See full documentation on [MongoDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb)
```js
let db = await mongo.db("DB_NAME");
let collection = await db.collection("COLLECTION_NAME");
let resultOn = await collection.findOne({});
let result = await collection.find({});
mongo.close();
```

<br/>
<br/>

# MySQL
Connection pools help reduce the time spent connecting to the MySQL server by reusing a previous connection, leaving them open instead of closing when you are done with them.

See full documentation on [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)

```js
let mysql = await hqDB({
	type: "mysql",
	database: "DB_NAME",
	user: "USER_NAME",
	password: "PASSWORD",
	connectionLimit: 2
});
```

### Return
```js
{
	"type": "mysql",
	"database": "DB_NAME",
	"user": "USER_NAME",
	"connectionLimit": 2,
	"pool": Pool
}
```

### Base methods
```js
let result = await mysql.query("YOUR_QUERY",[]); // Sync
mysql.query("YOUR_QUERY", [], function(err,result){}); // Async
mysql.pool.end();
```
